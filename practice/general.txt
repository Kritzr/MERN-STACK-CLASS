To open a new React project folder and get started with a new React application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
Before you start, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. **Download and install Node.js** from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Verify the installation by running these commands in your terminal/command prompt:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both.

### Step 2: Create a New React App

React provides an official tool called **Create React App** to quickly set up a new React application.

1. **Open your terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal on Mac)**.
2. **Navigate to the folder** where you want to create your new React app. You can use the `cd` command to change directories:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```

3. **Create a new React application**:
   Run the following command to create a new React app. Replace `my-app` with the name of your app (you can name it anything you like):
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

   - This will take a few minutes as it installs the necessary dependencies for your React app.

### Step 3: Navigate into the Project Folder

After the project has been created, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Now that your React app is set up, you can start the development server to see the app running:

```bash
npm start
```

- This will open your new React app in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- The development server will watch for changes, so any modifications you make in the code will automatically reload the page.

### Step 5: Open the Project in a Code Editor

Open the `my-app` folder in your code editor (like **VSCode** or **Sublime Text**). For example, in **VSCode**, you can run:

```bash
code .
```

### Step 6: Modify Your React App

You can start editing the files in the `src/` folder to build your application. The default template is located in `src/App.js`, which is where the main component of your React app is located.

### Summary of the Commands:
1. **Create a React app**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
2. **Navigate into the folder**:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

After this, you can start building your app by modifying the code in the `src` folder.
