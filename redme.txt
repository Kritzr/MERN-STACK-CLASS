What is a Callback Function?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, and it’s called (executed) later inside that outer function.

It allows you to control the order of execution, especially in asynchronous code (like fetching data, event listeners, or timers).

 Why use callbacks?
Because JavaScript is non-blocking and runs code asynchronously. So we need a way to say, “Hey, run this after you're done!”

 Basic Example
js
Copy
Edit
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hi, " + name);
  callback();  // calling the callback function
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Bye!");
}

greet("Krithika", sayBye);
Output:


Edit
Hi, Krithika
Bye!
Here, sayBye is passed as a callback and executed after greeting.

With Asynchronous Code (like setTimeout)
js
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
Here, the anonymous function is a callback that runs after 2 seconds.

📥 Another Common Use – Array Methods
js


const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach(function (num) {
  console.log(num * 2);  // callback for each item
});
Summary
Term	Meaning
Callback	A function passed as an argument to be "called back" later
Usage	Async code, event handlers, array methods, etc.
Syntax	someFunction(anotherFunction)


let a=(v1)=>{
  let newvalue="this is from a"
  vi(newvalue)
  //console.log(v1)
}
let b=()=>{

}
a("hi")
a("hello")
a(b) //am passing the function itself, so we wont put ()after b. if i do so, it will call the b function.


we use regular expression to validate the inputs in forms
for example, a regex for mobile number based on indian mobile = "^[6-9]+[0-9]{9}$"
here ^ means
     must start with 6-9
     can have anyother number after it . use '+' for concatenation 
     {9} number of digits
     $ ends the string

onchange() is triggered when there is a state change. -> asks for the callback function
onchange(x) -> x is the data stored
